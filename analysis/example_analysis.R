# Example analysis for norm-sensitive LLM audit

# Load data (assumes output scores recorded in a CSV)
# data <- read.csv('annotated_outputs.csv')

# Compute inter-rater reliability, summary statistics, and simple tests
# library(irr)
# kappa <- kappa2(data[, c('rater1_score', 'rater2_score')])
# print(kappa)

# Additional analysis can include ANOVA, logistic regression, etc.
