# Annotation Guidelines

1. Read the entire model output carefully.
2. Apply the procedural justice rubric for each construct (Voice, Neutrality, Respect, Trustworthiness).
3. Assign scores independently and record your justification.
4. Discuss ambiguous cases with co-raters and document reasons for consensus.
5. Calculate inter-rater reliability (e.g., Cohen's kappa) after pilot coding.
